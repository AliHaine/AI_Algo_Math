## Intro: Vector

In mathematics a vector is an object that contains multiple values (also called components). These values can represent
many things, but they are most commonly used to describe quantities that have both magnitude (side) and direction.

The simplest example of a vector is in the 2D coordinate system. Here, a vector has two components:

$\vec{v}$ = (x, y)

The first value x represents the horizontal component, and the second value y represents the vertical component.

So, if you imagine a point in the plane at coordinates (x, y), the vector can be drawn as an arrow starting from the origin
(0, 0) and pointing to (x, y).

Vectors are not limited to just two dimensions:

In 3D space, a vector has three components (x, y, z).

In general, a vector can have many number of components (v1, v2, ..., $v^n$).

This makes vectors useful for geometry physics, computer graphics, machine learning, and more, since they can describe directions,
forces, velocities, colors, or even abstract data.
